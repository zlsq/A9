We have two scripts working now:

* The euro scripts can run 12rd level of EURO SHOWN in chapter 4 without stopping.
    * Run it at the homepage of Asphalt 9.
    * This script finish a race in one and a half minute on average, which means **more than 90000 credits** per hour.
    * If you have been interrupted by advertisement, please contact us with the origin screenshots of ad.
    * If you found that it continuously back and back, please enlarge the number in Line 448.
* New Car Unleashed. It seems that the SPECIAL EVENT has replaced the New Car Unleashed event, so this script probably has no use now.
* Watch Advertisement
    * Choose the car which you want to refill its gas, and click **SKIP**, then run it.
